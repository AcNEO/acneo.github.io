## How to contribute to AcNEO's repositorys

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue** if the bug is not known unless there is error message or prove.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/AcNEO/<repos>/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/AcNEO/<repos>/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our wikis.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to AcNEO's repository](https://AcNEO.github.io/dir/CONTRIBUTING.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of <repos> will generally not be accepted unless I found it __pleasent__ in my eye.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [AcNEO: discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/acneo-discussion) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use AcNEO's Repository in the [AcNEO: discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/acneo-discussion).
